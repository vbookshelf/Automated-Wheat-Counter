1. Update the server.
$ sudo apt-get update


2. Install the pre-requisites
(Copy a line. Paste it. Press enter. Copy and paste the next line.)


$ sudo apt-get install \
> apt-transport-https \
> ca-certificates \
> curl \
> software-properties-common


3. Download gpg key for docker and add it to our machine
fsSL keeps the result as small as OK.
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -


4. Verify the key
The last eight characters of the fingerprint should match 0EBFCD88.
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88



5. Create a repository (called ‘stable’) and add to it.
(Copy a line. Paste it. Press enter. Copy and paste the next line.)


$ sudo add-apt-repository \
> “deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
> $(lsb_release -cs) \
> stable”


If there is an error when you enter the above lines then copy and pasting in the entire highlighted line below should resolve the error:

$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"




6. Run the update again to reflect the changes
$ sudo apt-get update




7. Install Docker
Ce means community edition. This is the free edition.
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce


8. Verify that the installation was successful
This will run a container called hello-world, which will only be possible if the docker installation was successful.
$ sudo docker run hello-world

1. Fetch the binaries of docker compose from its official github release. We will store this on our machine.
(Copy and paste the entire line.)


$ sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o/usr/local/bin/docker-compose


2. Make the binaries executable
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


3. Check if the installation was successful
$ docker-compose --version




The End.
